//LOGIC FOR PROJECT CALCULATOR
//on click of a number it reflects on a div first-display(second display design exists already but its div doesnt)
//on click of a numeric sign (+,-,* and /) it creates another div (second-display)(these carries the power to toggle between classes)
//(and the equals to button(=) has the power to also toggle)
//oncreation of this div,the screen gets split into two(first display) and (second display)
// the one ontop(second-display) holds the current number and a numeric sign e.g 22+
//first display content has gotten cleared
//the one below(first-display) would reflect the new set of numbers you're typing in ---NOTE:first display content got shifted
//to second display
//onclick of equals to button,the answer shows up at the first display and second display gets toggled out
//a clear button that would wipe out the current data
//a delete button that would delete one character for the current screen
// i expect bugs at the end of this,so relax and have fun cheers
